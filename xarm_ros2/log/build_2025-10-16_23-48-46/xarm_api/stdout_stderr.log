  By not providing "Findcontrol_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project

  Add the installation prefix of "control_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set

  "control_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "control_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
